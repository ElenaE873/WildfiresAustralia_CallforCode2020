# WildfiresAustralia_CallforCode2020

This repository documents the process that took place as part of being involved in the call-for-code prediction of wildfires in Australia for the Call-for-Code 2020.  I have decided to share the notebooks, the lessons, and the documentation that I, personally, logged throughout the process.  I hope others will find some of this useful for their passionate endeavors.  It was definitely an experience to remember, for me, personally.

In addition to what I have in this respository, you may find additional information and background here:
